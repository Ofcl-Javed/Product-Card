## My process
- I use Sass preprocessor to style and use basic approch to make it happen
- Starting with basic html i styled it one by one top down approch
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension/preprocessor

### What I learned

I learned how easy sass can be and nesting in css which makes selection of element easy. Variable and multiples modules of style is very helpful in DRY and reading.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning css frameworks like SASS, Tailwind css etc to make css easy to  unuderstand and reusable.

### Useful resources

- [Resource](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - This helped me for SASS syntax. I really liked this documention, easy to understand
